This project presents an innovative approach to automating network design in Cisco Packet Tracer through artificial intelligence and natural language processing.
We develop a pipeline that translates natural language descriptions into functional network configurations, significantly reducing the technical barriers
in network simulation. By reverse engineering the Packet Tracer file format and implementing a dual-LLM architecture, our system successfully generates valid
network topologies from user descriptions. The solution demonstrates high accuracy in component identification, connection mapping, and IP address allocation.
While currently limited to Packet Tracer version 5, our approach establishes a foundation for more accessible network design tools. Results show successful
automation of basic to moderate network configurations, with potential applications in educational settings and professional training environments.
